A smart-home personal assistant that help home dwellers and their guests to perform common actions, feel comfortable at home and interface with other home-automation systems. The product is intended for a young and adult target that want to make their home smarter with a low budget. The system is minimally composed by a flying drone, and a local server; optional components are smart appliances (eg. lights or windows), a personal EEG (eg. Mindwave, Emotiv), third parts home assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Home) and an internet connection, for enhanced features.

**Background**: today, home assistants like Alexa or Google Home are quite common in several houses, but they face some issues. First of all, they are static and cannot move around the home to follow dwellers or perform tasks. Air vehicle is a natural choice to solve this problem since they have no limitation of scattered floor, stairs and similar. A personal EEG may be used to call the drone anywhere in the house and adjust the system behavior according to the mental state of the user.
